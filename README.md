Unfinished, still working game programming project/prototype on tiny scale.

Uses [My Basic](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic) and M5Core with Faces to generate fun.

As of now:

- Can render gfx
- Can print text
- Can draw pixels
- Can draw textures (BMP)
- Can save
- Can work with keyboards
- Has a simple code editor

Maybe-a-todo-list:

- Save/Load menu
- Texture editor
- Splash screen !
- Support other faces (like the game one)
